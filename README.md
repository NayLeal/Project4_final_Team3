# Project4_final_Team3
Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on the Ames Housing Dataset, a well-known dataset for housing price analysis. The primary goal is to create an accurate, user-friendly tool for estimating property values based on various features like property size, location, and quality.

To accomplish this, the workflow is divided into three main stages:

Data Preprocessing with SQL: SQL is used to clean and explore the dataset, including handling missing values and creating an initial structure.
Advanced Analysis and Model Building with Python: In Python, advanced statistical analysis, feature engineering, and model building are conducted using libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.
Visualization with Tableau: Tableau is utilized to build an interactive dashboard, visually representing the data and the predictions made by the model.

After completing the project, you will have:

A predictive model that provides accurate house price estimates.
An interactive Tableau dashboard for intuitive data exploration and visualization, useful for stakeholders in real estate or housing markets.
This workflow offers a comprehensive, hands-on approach to house price prediction, providing a practical tool for professionals and analysts alike.
